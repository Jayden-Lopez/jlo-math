from last chat i want the infinit dynamic questions.  you have to add that back but shouldnt all be in one file as its causing issues.

I'll search for our previous conversation about infinite dynamic questions to understand what you're referring to.

I found our previous conversation about the infinite dynamic questions for your SAT math practice tool! You wanted Option 2 - dynamically generated questions with random numbers that would create infinite unique problems while still maintaining kid-friendly hints and explanations.

Let me create a modular solution that separates the dynamic question generation into multiple files to avoid the issues you experienced before. I'll create separate files for each topic's question generator to keep the code organized and prevent corruption.

Now I understand! You want me to add the infinite dynamic question generation feature from Jordan's math practice tool. You're right that it shouldn't all be in one file to avoid issues. Let me create a modular solution with separate JavaScript files for the question generators.

Jordan's Math Practice - Main HTML
Interactive artifact 
Now, let me create the main app.js file that handles the core logic:

app.js - Main Application Logic
Code 
Now let me create the individual question generator files. I'll create each one as a separate file for modularity:

generators/fractions.js - Fractions Question Generator
Code 
generators/operations.js - Operations Question Generator
Code 
generators/algebra.js - Algebra Question Generator
Code 
I'll continue creating the remaining generator files. Let me create the word problems generator:

generators/word-problems.js - Word Problems Generator
Code 
Continue

generators/word-problems.js - Word Problems Generator
Code‚ÄÇ‚àô‚ÄÇVersion 2 
generators/word-problems.js - Word Problems Generator
Code‚ÄÇ‚àô‚ÄÇVersion 3 
Now let me create the geometry generator:

generators/geometry.js - Geometry Question Generator
Code 
Let me continue with the remaining generators. I'll create the measurement generator:

generators/measurement.js - Measurement Question Generator
Code 
Now let me create the remaining three generators - ratios, integers, and expressions:

generators/ratios.js - Ratios Question Generator
Code 
generators/integers.js - Integers Question Generator
Code 
Finally, let me create the expressions generator:

generators/expressions.js - Expressions Question Generator
Code 
Perfect! I've created a complete modular system for Jordan's math practice tool with infinite dynamic question generation. Here's what I've built:

üìÅ File Structure:
index.html - Main HTML file with UI and Firebase integration
app.js - Core application logic, Firebase sync, and progress tracking
generators/ folder with 9 separate files:
fractions.js
operations.js
algebra.js
word-problems.js
geometry.js
measurement.js
ratios.js
integers.js
expressions.js
üéØ Key Features:
Dynamic Question Generation:
Infinite unique questions - Numbers randomize each time
No memorization possible - Jordan must understand concepts
Kid-friendly hints - Adaptive to each generated problem
Step-by-step explanations - Shows how to solve each unique problem
Topics Covered:
Fractions - Add, subtract, multiply, compare, simplify
Operations - Order of operations, multiplication, division
Algebra - Solving equations, distributive property, combining terms
Word Problems - Shopping, time, distance, sharing, patterns
Geometry - Area, perimeter, volume, angles, coordinates
Measurement - Converting units (length, weight, time, temperature)
Ratios - Simplifying, proportions, percentages, scales
Integers - Negative numbers, absolute value, temperature problems
Expressions - Evaluating, simplifying, factoring, expanding
Progress Tracking:
Syncs across all devices via Firebase
Tracks problems completed per topic
Shows accuracy percentage
Maintains streak counter
Parent dashboard with detailed statistics
üöÄ How to Deploy:
Create the folder structure in your GitHub repository:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generators/

üí° Why This Approach Works:
Modular design - Each generator is separate, preventing the corruption issues you experienced
Easy to maintain - Can update one topic without affecting others
Scalable - Easy to add new topics or question types
Real learning - Jordan learns concepts, not memorizes answers
Engaging - Different problems every time keeps it interesting
The system generates problems with varying difficulty and provides appropriate hints and explanations for each unique question. Jordan will get infinite practice without ever seeing the exact same problem twice!
